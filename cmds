1. Stopping the Application 🛑
Since the app has two parts (the Docker backend and the Node.js frontend), you need to stop both:

Stop the Frontend: Go to the terminal where npm run dev is running and press Ctrl + C.
Stop the Backend: Run this command in your main project directory:
powershell


docker-compose down


This safely stops and removes the indexer and database containers without losing your data.
2. Starting the Application Again 🚀
When you're ready to use it again, run these two commands:

Step 1: Start the Backend (Database & Indexer)

powershell


docker-compose up -d


The -d flag runs it in the background so it doesn't take up your terminal.

Step 2: Start the Frontend

powershell


cd frontend
npm run dev
